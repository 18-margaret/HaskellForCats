-- Eq where each component == component 
-- Ord where (<),(>),(<=),(>=) component to component
-- Show gives us show "component"
--                      "[Constructor-name] {argument-1} {argument-2}..." 
-- Read which gives the read function 
--    Deriving-parse output of default show 

-- Minimum complete definition
-- must be satisfied     

-- we create new type classes when to not have them would require excessive amounts of definitions, because we want polymorphic functionality on a function. 

-- Subclasses work as refinements on the Superclass. Eq just allows for comparison where as Ord which inherits from Eq allows other comparisons (<),(>),(<=),(>=) which would not be possible to do with out first checking if two elements were the same or not.
