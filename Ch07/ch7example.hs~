Haskell Curry (1900 - 1982) where we get language name and a primary feature of it. 

Moses Schonfinkel (1889-1942) 
His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators B, C, I, K, and S. Sch√∂nfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just K and S and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same His paper also showed that functions of two or more arguments could be replaced by functions taking a single argument. This replacement mechanism simplifies work in both combinatory logic and lambda calculus and would later be called currying, after Haskell Curry power as predicate logic
